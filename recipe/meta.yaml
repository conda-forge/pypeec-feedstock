about:
  summary: PyPEEC - 3D PEEC Solver
  description: |
    PyPEEC is a 3D quasi-magnetostatic PEEC solver developed at Dartmouth
    College within the Power Management Integration Center (PMIC). PyPEEC 
    is a fast solver (FFT and GPU accelerated) that can simulate a large 
    variety of magnetic components (inductors, transformers, chokes, IPT 
    coils, busbars, etc.). The tool contains a mesher (STL, PNG, and GERBER 
    formats), a solver (static and frequency domain), and advanced plotting 
    capabilities. The code is written in Python and is fully open source!
